Hi! This another simple program I completed in my Introduction to Programming/UNIX Basics course. Essentially, it
tests three strategies of approaching the "Let's Make a Deal!" game, better known as the Monty Hall puzzle. The three tested options
are always staying with initial choice of door, always switching to the unpicked, unopened door, or flipping a coin to decide whether to 
stay with the initial choice or switch. The program runs 1000 simulations of each, and prints the results to teh console.
